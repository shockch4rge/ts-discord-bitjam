# Yet Another Discord Music Bot
I love using Discord, so why not make another generic music bot for personal use? I got really interested in the way the other bots out there handled commands, queries, and all sorts of interactions, so I got to researching and creating my own.

## Description
A pet project coded in my free time using TypeScript, which helps me to understand the fundamentals of the modern TS syntax and the event-based architecture. Uses ts-node as runtime.

This was originally written in JavaScript, but I got really fed up with loose typing (coming from a Java background). This project was then [migrated over from JavaScript].

## Libraries
- [`discord.js`]
- [`@discordjs/voice`]
- [`ytdl-core`]
- [`youtube-search`]
- [`ts-node`]
